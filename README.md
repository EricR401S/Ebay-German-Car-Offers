## <center> Summary of Results <center>

#### The cars were sold from 2015 to April 2016. The selling period spiked mostly during March 2016 and peaked at its highest during April 6th, then the 7th and 5th of the same year. In terms of the registration year, 58% of used cars are from the 2000s, with the remainder dating mostly to 1999 and older. As for the car brands, the most recurring brands were "volkswagen" (21% of the pool), "bmw", "mercedes_benz", "opel", "audi", "ford". These top 6 brands totaled over 60% of the used car pool. Lastly, the car's mileage was moderately high as well as their mean registration year, 12 to 14 years old. However, their prices were much more telling about the behavior of the top most frequent brands. The low end was occupied by the "opel"at 3,394. The high end was near the 10,000 euro mark with the "audi", "bmw", and "mercedez_benz", while the much more frequent "volkswagen" was at a mean of 6,000 euros. The prices were very spread out, but generally expensive.
